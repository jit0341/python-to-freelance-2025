# calculator
1.i define add, subtract, multiply and divide taking two variable(a,b)
2. After each def function I return each operation like return a + b
3. I put a condition if b== not 0. Return error message.
4.I run while loop. ask to input first number and second number via print command in variables 'a' and 'b'.
5. Third variable 'operation' for taking operators ( + - * / ) as input.
6. use conditional 'if'
   for '+' called result= add(a,b)
   then print result
   for '-' used 'elif'
   called result = subtract(a,b)
   for * used second 'elif'
   for / used third 'elif'
   else is used for other operation or else.7. I used variable continue_cal to ask user if wanted another calculation 'yes/no'.
   then conditional 'if' used . if 'no' calculation stops if 'yes' calculation continues.
