# Challenge 1: Use list comprehension to get all Food items
food_items = [exp for exp in expenses if exp['category'] == "Food"]

# Challenge 2: Use lambda + sorted to sort by amount (highest first)
sorted_by_amount = sorted(expenses,key=lambda x:x['amount'], reverse = True)

# Challenge 3: Use map to get just the amounts

# Challenge 4: Use filter to get expenses over â‚¹500
big_expenses = list(filter(lambda x:x ['amount']> 500,expenses))
